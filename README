This is a collection of simple functions that I want to only 
write once, and never again.  

Current additions:

Sockets
	sockets.{h,c} - 2 simple server/client functions that return a socket.

Primes
	A small slow program to find all primes up to a given number.
	Very slow algorithm, multi-threaded.
