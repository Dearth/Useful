This is a collection of simple functions that I want to only 
write once, and never again.  

Current additions:

Sockets
	sockets.{h,c} - 2 simple server/client functions that return a socket.

Primes
	Finder
		A small slow program to find all primes up to a given number.
		Very slow algorithm, multicore.
	Primer
		A goroutine based primality tester.  Slow tests remainders up
		to square root of prime.

Passer
	Writes an 20 x 20 block of text that can be used for random passwords.

Cyper
	A small program that reads in a message file and XORs the bytes with a
	key text.
